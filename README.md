# NumericalMethodsAlgorithms
## Description
* Repository containing three MatLab numerical methods algorithms I created
* Each folder contains an algorithm along with a README.md file offering a brief description of each algorithm
## Contents
* **falsePosition** - Performs falsePosition method to calculate roots of a function with user control over error and iteration count
* **luFactor** - Performs LU Factorization with partial pivoting on a square matrix
* **Simpson** - Performs Simpson's 1/3 Rule to calculate a numerical integral
